LMAC Core1 and LMAC Core2 have the same architecture. The software device driver is similar for both cores.

----------------------------------------------------------

The Co-Simulation process for LMAC_CORE1 is the same as LMAC_CORE2. Please refer to the following link:

	https://github.com/lewiz-support/LMAC_CORE2/tree/master/Software_Driver

This link will redirect you to the LMAC_CORE2 repository. Here you can find the device driver source code for LMAC Core1 & 2, README file, Specification and instructions for performing Co-simulation.

A video of the co-simulation demo is available at:
