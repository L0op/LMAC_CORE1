Use these for examples as they contain easier to understand scripts.

Functional test cases: 
Provided as a back up reference.
These are additional test cases to test specific function to complement the performance tests.

Simulation Tools:
1.	ModelSim

Testing procedures:

For ModelSim: 
Start Modelsim, then
Just run the script that provided in each test case.
