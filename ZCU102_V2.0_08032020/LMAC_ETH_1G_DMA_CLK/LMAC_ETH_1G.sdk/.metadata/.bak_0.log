Otherwise, undefined results occur. When DMACR.RS is 1, CURDESC_PTR becomes Read Only (RO) and is used to fetch the first descriptor.
When the DMA Engine is running (DMACR.RS=1), CURDESC_PTR registers are updated by AXI DMA to indicate the current descriptor being worked on.
On error detection, CURDESC_PTR is updated to reflect the descriptor associated with the detected error.
Note: The register can only be written to by the CPU when the DMA Engine is Halted (DMACR.RS=0 and DMASR.Halted =1). At all other times, this register is Read Only (RO). Descriptors must be 16 word aligned, that is, 0x00, 0x40, 0x80 and others. Any other alignment has undefined results.

When AXI DMA Channel is not halted (DMASR.Halted = 0), a write by the CPU to the TAILDESC_PTR register causes the AXI DMA SG Engine to start fetching descriptors or restart if it was idle (DMASR.Idle = 1). If it was not idle, writing TAILDESC_PTR has no effect except to reposition the pause point.
If the AXI DMA Channel DMACR.RS bit is set to 0 (DMASR.Halted = 1 and DMACR.RS = 0), a write by the CPU to the TAILDESC_PTR register has no effect except to reposition the pause point.
Note: The software must not move the tail pointer to a location that has not been updated. The software processes and reallocates all completed descriptors (Cmplted = 1), clears the completed bits and then moves the tail pointer. The software must move the pointer to the last descriptor it updated. 
Descriptors must be 16-word aligned, that is, 0x00, 0x40, 0x80, and so forth. Any other alignment has undefined results.

"desc": "Indicates the pause pointer in a descriptor chain. The AXI DMA SG Engine pauses descriptor fetching after completing operations on the descriptor whose current descriptor pointer matches the tail descriptor pointer.
When AXI DMA Channel is not halted (DMASR.Halted = 0), a write by the CPU to the TAILDESC_PTR register causes the AXI DMA SG Engine to start fetching descriptors or restart if it was idle (DMASR.Idle = 1). If it was not idle, writing TAILDESC_PTR has no effect except to reposition the pause point.
If the AXI DMA Channel is halted (DMASR.Halted = 1 and DMACR.RS = 0), a write by the CPU to the TAILDESC_PTR register has no effect except to reposition the pause point.
Note: The software must not move the tail pointer to a location that has not been updated. The software processes and reallocates all completed descriptors (Cmplted = 1), clears the completed bits and then moves the tail pointer. The software must move the pointer to the last descriptor it updated. Descriptors must be 16-word aligned, that is, 0x00, 0x40, 0x80, and so forth. Any other alignment has undefined results.
